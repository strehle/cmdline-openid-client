 # SAP Cloud Identity Services - openid-client
 
This project provides a command line interface (CLI) to generate OpenID (OIDC) Tokens from an OIDC complaint serverr, mainly created to test new features like PKCE and Public Client support or Private Key JWT. Mainly for IAS compliance tests. However, any other OIDC provider can be used to get tokens.
The API documentation is available here: https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/openid-connect  

The execution will open a port on you localhost machine. Please ensure that this port is usable. In addition, you need to specify the redirect_uri in your OIDC server,
e.g. http://localhost:8080/callback. If you set port 9002, expect redirect_uri http://localhost:9002/callback

### How to build the project

Use the go tool chain to build the binary.
```text
go install github.com/strehle/cmdline-openid-client/openid-client@latest
```

You can also use go with run to execute it like
```text
go run github.com/strehle/cmdline-openid-client/openid-client@latest
```

Another option is to clone the sources and build it from command 
```text
go build openid-client/openid-client.go
```
On an OS with make environment, simply execute
```text
make
```
### How to test

Usage: openid-client <command> <flags>
       This is a CLI to generate tokens from an OpenID Connect (OIDC) complaint server. Create a service provider/application in the OIDC server with call back url:
       http://localhost:<port>/callback and set below flags to get an ID token

Command: (authorization_code is default)
       authorization_code Perform authorization code flow.
       client_credentials Perform client credentials flow.
       password           Perform resource owner flow, also known as password flow.
       token-exchange     Perform OAuth2 Token Exchange (RFC 8693).
       jwt-bearer         Perform OAuth2 JWT Bearer Grant Type.
       saml-bearer        Perform OAuth2 SAML 2.0 Bearer Grant Type.

      -client_id        OIDC client ID. This is a mandatory flag.
      -client_secret    OIDC client secret. This is an optional flag and only needed for confidential clients.
      -client_tls       P12 file for client mTLS authentication. This is an optional flag and only needed for confidential clients as replacement for client_secret.
      -client_jwt       P12 file for private_key_jwt authentication. This is an optional flag and only needed for confidential clients as replacement for client_secret.
      -client_jwt_key   Private Key in PEM for private_key_jwt authentication. Use this parameter together with -client_jwt_kid. Replaces -client_jwt and -pin.
      -client_jwt_kid   Key ID for private_key_jwt authentication. Use this parameter together with -client_jwt_key. Replaces -client_jwt and -pin, use value or path to X509 certificate.
      -client_jwt_x5t   Header for private_key_jwt X509 authentication. Use this parameter together with -client_jwt_key. Replaces -client_jwt and -pin, use value or path to X509 certificate.
      -client_assertion External client token to perform client authentication. Use this parameter instead of client_jwt or client_jwt_key parameters.
      -bearer           Own token to perform client API authentication. The value will be set in authorization header as bearer value.
      -assertion        Input token for token exchanges, e.g. jwt-bearer or token-exchange and other token information endpoints.
      -scope            OIDC scope parameter. This is an optional flag, default is openid. If you set none, the parameter scope will be omitted in request.

### How to test in automation without showing secrets
In environments with outlog to logs or others it might be needed to hide the secrets and/or client details.
There are some environment variables, which will be used if set. A variable passed to the command itself always as prio before the
environment, but you can also mix input parameters and environment.

* OPENID_ISSUER The issuer of the OIDC server. Useful if you re-use a command often to omit it from a command. 
* OPENID_ID The client_id parameter.
* OPENID_SECRET The client_secret parameter.
* OPENID_FORMAT The format of the access_token. Possible values are jwt or opaque.

Example
```text
openid-client client_credentials
```
or with some information
```text
openid-client client_credentials -client_id xxxxx
```
